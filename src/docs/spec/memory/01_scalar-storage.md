# Scalar Storage

Primitive scalar payloads are stored in their native runtime value size inside a
collection data region.

| Type | Payload size |
|------|--------------|
| `Boolean` | 1 byte payload, stored as canonical `0` or `1` |
| `Byte` | 1 byte |
| `Integer` | 8 bytes |
| `Float` | 8 bytes |
| `Fixed` | 8 bytes |

Payloads in the data region are aligned so every payload begins at an offset
valid for that payload's type. Padding bytes are not observable. [[src/target/shared/code/builder_collection_layout.rs:collection_payload_alignment]]
