# Standard Package Semantics

The semantic and algorithmic *models* of the standard packages — those
implemented as injected MFBASIC source, plus those backed by native seam helpers:
the regex engine, the date/time model, the CSV dialect, the JSON data model, the
HTTP client, the URL model, the `math::` PCG64 RNG, the bit-operation primitives,
the exact base-10 `money::` model, and the OS environment/introspection surface.
These are the parts a faithful reimplementation needs that the per-function API
reference does not capture.

The per-function API of each package — signatures, parameters, return types,
errors — is owned by `./mfb man <package>` (e.g. `./mfb man regex`). This package
specifies the *behavior behind* that API. How these packages are injected into a
build is `./mfb spec architecture frontend`; their source-package mechanics are
`./mfb spec architecture monomorphization` (generic instantiation) and the
built-in injection chain.

## Reading order

- `regex` — pattern grammar, the CPS backtracking matcher and its leftmost-first
  preference order, supported syntax, flags, and scalar-based matching.
- `datetime` — the Instant/Duration/Date/Time model, civil-calendar math, the OS
  clock/zone seam, and parse/format rules.
- `csv` — the RFC-4180-aligned dialect (delimiters, quoting, record separators).
- `json` — the `Json` union data model and parse/stringify behavior.
- `http` — the HTTP/1.1 client model (the `Response` record, header handling,
  caps, transport selection).
- `url` — the URL parsing/rendering model (`net::Url`).
- `math-rng` — the PCG64 algorithm, seeding, and `math::seed` semantics.
- `encoding` — the byte↔text and Unicode codec models (UTF-8/16/32, the
  hex/Base32/Base64 families, percent/form escaping, HTML entities, Punycode, and
  the LEB128/varint integer codecs), built on the `bits` package and
  `strings::toBytes`. The integer bitwise/shift/rotate primitives in `bits` are
  native single-instruction operations documented in `./mfb man bits`.
- `vector` — the nine fixed-width math-vector value records and the overloaded
  geometry/interpolation/utility/2D functions over them: the value model, the
  type-resolved dispatch, the per-function formulas, the single round-half-away
  Integer rule, and the no-libm determinism guarantee.
- `audio` — the raw `s16le` PCM model: the frame layout, the exact-or-timeout
  `read` rule, the block-until-queued `write` rule, `available`/`xruns` meanings,
  the static-direction/non-sendable/no-duplex consequences, the AudioQueue and
  ALSA backends, and the error model.
- `bits` — the integer bit-operation model: operand width and two's-complement
  representation, the logical/shift/rotate/bit-count/byte-swap op families and
  their exact semantics, and the single-native-instruction determinism guarantee.
- `money` — the exact base-10 fixed-point model behind the `Money` type: the
  fixed scale, the per-arena rounding-mode state, and `money::round` behavior.
- `os` — the environment and process-introspection model: the raising vs
  non-raising accessors, the `environ` snapshot, the build-target constants, and
  the may-fail host lookups.
